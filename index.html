    <h3>About Jacob</h3>
    <p>Upon high school graduation, I entered into the manufacturing field where I have been a physical laborer ever since. While I love being physically active in my work, I have always had an interest in Technology and Software Development.</p>
    <p>Enrolling as a student at Thinkful has put me on track to become a Software Developer and I am very excited to see what fun, creative work I can do.</p>
    <p>I am thrilled to work with other developers and I cannot wait to start this journey! </p>
